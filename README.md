# MediaCentral Explorer

![Main screen](.github/data/main-screen.png)

MediaCentral Explorer is a desktop app and command-line tool for browsing an
Avid MediaCentral workgroup and exporting readable asset metadata.

It is designed for people who need to quickly inspect projects, bins,
sequences, master clips, and related metadata without manually opening and
copying details from MediaCentral.

## What It Does

- Connects to an Avid MediaCentral Web Services endpoint
- Browses projects from an Interplay path
- Loads project contents, including bins, sequences, master clips, subclips, and folders
- Exports formatted metadata that can be pasted into an email or saved as text
- Lets you choose which metadata fields are included
- Copies results to the clipboard, saves them to a `.txt` file, or opens them in your email client
- Saves connection settings between sessions
- Stores credentials in Windows Credential Manager or macOS Keychain when available

## When To Use It

Use MediaCentral Explorer when you need to:

- Send a clean summary of project media to another person
- Check what clips, bins, or sequences exist inside a project
- Export metadata for production notes, handovers, troubleshooting, or audit trails
- Automate MediaCentral metadata lookups from scripts
- Quickly test whether a MediaCentral Web Services endpoint is reachable

## Download The App

The latest packaged app is available from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/markbattistella/avid-interplay-metadata-exporter/releases/latest).

Download the installer for your platform:

- macOS: `MCExplorer.dmg`
- Windows: `MCExplorer-Setup.exe`

## Using The Desktop App

1. Open MediaCentral Explorer.
2. Enter your MediaCentral server address.
3. Enter your username and password.
4. Enter the Interplay path you want to browse, for example:

   ```text
   interplay://AvidWorkgroup/Projects/2026
   ```

5. Load the project list.
6. Select a project to load its bins, sequences, clips, and metadata.
7. Choose the fields you want included in the output.
8. Copy, save, or email the formatted result.

Server addresses are normalised automatically:

- `192.168.0.1` becomes `http://192.168.0.1:80`
- `https://192.168.0.1` becomes `https://192.168.0.1:443`
- `192.168.0.1:12345` becomes `http://192.168.0.1:12345`
- `https://192.168.0.1:12345` stays `https://192.168.0.1:12345`
